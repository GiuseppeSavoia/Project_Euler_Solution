// Sum square difference

// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
// 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 
// (1 + 2 + ... + 10 )^2 = 3025

//Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
// 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
