# Project Euler solutions in C++

---

This repository contains my solutions in C++ to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

I'm a beginner in programming and the code quality and efficiency are definitely not the best. But practice makes perfect :)

If an error is found in one of my solutions or a suggest to make the code more efficient, feel free to open an issue here, specifying exactly what went wrong and where, so I can easily fix it.
